                        <h2>Novice Routine Summary</h2>
                        <p>The basic routine calls for 3 exercises across every rep range. You'll do legs, your front upper body muscles and your back upper body muscles. It hits every muscle and every fiber type through every rep range using Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP), provides alternative exercises, and helps you practice your technique more than other routines.</p>

                        <h2>3x5 Heavy:</h2>
                        <p>There are 3 types of muscle fiber. This day specifically targets the type IIx glycolytic, the "fast-twitch." These muscles run on creatine phosphate and glycogen, they fatigue easily, but they produce a lot of force; think of an Olympic sprinter. It might feel like you have more in the tank and feeling like you could exercise more, but don't. The point of this day is to lift as much weight as possible with perfect form, not to fatigue. Strength training has a high nervous system requirement, which is trained by practicing moving explosively on the "up" portions of movement.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <p><b>Sets:</b> Perform 3 sets. If you have time, you can perform 5 sets. Beyond 5 sets seems to produce a decrease in the amount of weight you can lift.</p>
                            <p><b>Reps:</b> Perform 3 to 5 reps. If you cannot get 3 reps, on the next set, you must reduce the weight. Stick with this weight until you can complete 5 reps with the same weight for every set.</p>

                            <p><b>Rest:</b> You must rest 3-5 minutes in between sets. Don't jump around. Don't do another exercise. Sit there and listen to your music.</p>
                            <p><b>Intensity:</b> Use 85-90% of your 1 rep max, or 85-90% of the amount of weight that you could use for just one rep. Add weight when you can get 5 reps for all sets for two HEAVY workouts.</p>

Keep torso upright during squat; flexible hip flexors are important. With feet further apart: Gluteus Maximus is emphasized, Quadriceps are less emphasized.</p>
                                        <p>Easier: Hold onto rails or back of chairs to each side.</p>

                        <p>This day specifically targets the type I oxidative, the "slow-twitch." These muscles run primarily on oxygen. They do not fatigue easily, but they produce a lot less force; think of a marathon runner. While this is the "Light" day, it is by no means easy. Your muscles will burn, you will sweat more than the other days, and you will breathe heavier (because your muscles run on oxygen!)</p>

                            <p><b>Sets:</b> Perform 3 sets. If you have time, you can perform 5 sets. Beyond 5 sets seems to produce a decrease in the amount of weight you can lift.</p>
                            <p><b>Reps:</b> Perform 12-15 reps. If you cannot get 12 reps, on the next set, you must reduce the weight. Stick with this weight until you can complete 15 reps with the same weight for every set.</p>

                            <p><b>Intensity:</b> Use less than 75% of your 1 rep max, or less than 70% of the amount of weight that you could use for just one rep.  Add weight when you can hit 15 reps for every set for two LIGHT workouts.</p>
