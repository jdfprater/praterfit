                        <p>The grandaddy of programming is here: linear periodization. Time to broaden horizons and begin planning your 
                        workouts not just week-to-week or month-to-month. There is less room for alternative exercises simply because 
                        form follows function. If you want to look a certain way (form), your body has to move a certain way (function). 
                        Whether that means you need to do some serious learning or serious rehab, there really is no other way to get to 
                        your goal.<br><br></p>

                                <p><b>Sets:</b> Perform 3 sets. If you have time, you can perform 4 or 5 sets. Beyond 5 sets seems to produce a 
                                    decrease in the amount of weight you can lift, thus compromising the training effect.</p>
                                <p><b>Reps:</b> Reps are structured to change only after 4 weeks have passed. Stick to the prescription of 15 
                                    reps for the first month, 10 for the second, and 5 for the last month. Repeat.</p>

                                <p><b>Increase Weight:</b> When you can do 2 more reps with the weight that you have been using for 2 workouts, 
                                    you can increase weight no more than 10%.<br>Example: You start with a weight you can do for 3x3 and over 
                                    the course of several weeks, you work up to 3x5. When you can do 3x5 for two workouts, you can increase 
                                    the weight.</p>
                                <p><b>Intensity:</b> The 5's will be done first at 85-90% of your 1 RM<br>The 10's second at 70-75%.<br>The 15's 
                                    third at 65-75%.<br>There is a range prescribed so that you can adjust how much weight you need. There is a 
                                    difference between  doing 3x3 at 90% and 3x5 at 85%, so feel free to move around in the rep range AND the 
                                    intensity range, according to how you need to increase the weight and progress.</p>

                            <p><b>Instructions: </b>Perform each exercise in the order it is presented according to the rep and rest 
                                parameters of the month you're in. If you cannot perform one of the exercises due to mobility or 
                                technique reasons, a substitute is acceptable.<br><br>

                                That said, I'd recommend taking a step back and rehabilitating the lost range of motion (joints permitting) 
                                or practicing and making sure your skill with the lift is up to par (seek a professional, email me, or do 
                                some reading).<br><br>

                                If you cannot make the number of reps required on a bodyweight exercise, either use an assisted machine to 
                                make it easier and complete the prescribed number of reps OR do max reps with the bodyweight exercise and 
                                strive to complete the prescribed reps through all sets.</p>

                                parameters of the month you're in. If you cannot perform one of the exercises due to mobility or 
                                technique reasons, a substitute is acceptable.<br><br>

                                That said, I'd recommend taking a step back and rehabilitating the lost range of motion (joints permitting) 
                                or practicing and making sure your skill with the lift is up to par (seek a professional, email me, or do 
                                some reading).<br><br>

                                If you cannot make the number of reps required on a bodyweight exercise, either use an assisted machine to 
                                make it easier and complete the prescribed number of reps OR do max reps with the bodyweight exercise and 
                                strive to complete the prescribed reps through all sets.</p>

                            <p><b>Instructions: </b>Perform each exercise in the order it is presented according to the rep and rest 
                                parameters of the month you're in. If you cannot perform one of the exercises due to mobility or 
                                technique reasons, a substitute is acceptable.<br><br>

                                That said, I'd recommend taking a step back and rehabilitating the lost range of motion (joints permitting) 
                                or practicing and making sure your skill with the lift is up to par (seek a professional, email me, or do 
                                some reading).<br><br>

                                If you cannot make the number of reps required on a bodyweight exercise, either use an assisted machine to 
                                make it easier and complete the prescribed number of reps OR do max reps with the bodyweight exercise and 
                                strive to complete the prescribed reps through all sets.</p>

                                        range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso
                                        into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat
                                        involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall
                                        back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement.

                                If you cannot make the number of reps required on a bodyweight exercise, either use an assisted machine to 
                                make it easier and complete the prescribed number of reps OR do max reps with the bodyweight exercise and

                                                extension. Pull shoulders back at top of lift if rounded. Return weights to floor by 
                                                bending hips back while allowing knees to bend forward, keeping back straight and knees
                                                pointed same direction as feet. Repeat. Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, 
                                                arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. 
                                                Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance
                                                often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps,
                                                grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding

                                                with arms straight, chest high, hips low, and back straight.Extend knees and hips until legs
                                                are straight. Return and repeat. Use shoulder width grip since narrower than shoulder width
                                                grip will make it more difficult to lockout at top. Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders
                                                high, arms and back straight, and knees pointed out same direction as feet. Also, keep bar
                                                close to body to improve mechanical leverage. With wide stance, push feet out to sides and
                                                not down to prevent knees from buckling inward. Pushing knees out will allow hips to travel
                                                toward bar more quickly while improving leverage. During rep training for powerlifting, do
                                                not merely tap weight to ground, but instead let barbell settle to ground each rep to

                                                movement. Once stretch is felt or barbell contacts floor, return to original position by
                                                raising torso while lowering lifted leg. Straighten knee of supporting leg as torso becomes

                                            Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Stand on shallow platform if weight reaches floor 
                                            before stretch. Those with less flexibility may have to bend knees more. Knees can be kept bent throughout

                <h2>Accessory: Shoulders, Arms, Calves</h2>
                        <p>This workout is constructed and cycles through exercising the different heads of the biggest shoulder muscle, the deltoid. We
                            will also be working the biggest arm muscles, the biceps brachii and its associated muscles as well as the triceps brachii.
                            This is also the introduction of a different type of exercise: the isolation exercise. When we work arms, we exercise muscles
                            that cross only one joint, for example, the bicep curl moves and uses just the elbow; the wrist and shoulder remain stable.
                            This is  in contrast to a compound movement, which uses two joints. For instance, the squat moves the hip and the knee joint.

                            <p><b>Sets:</b> Perform 3 sets. If you have time, you can perform 5 sets. Beyond 5 sets seems to produce a 
                                decrease in the amount of weight you can lift.</p>
                            <p><b>Reps:</b> Everything in this workout uses 10-12 reps - in general, isolation exercises are done using at least 8 reps

                            <p><b>Intensity:</b> Use less than 75% of your 1 rep max, or less than 70% of the amount of weight that you 
                                could use for just one rep.  Add weight when you can hit 15 reps for every set for two LIGHT workouts.</p>

                        <p>You will cycle through three different exercises for each body part two times. The cycle begins with shoulders (moving 
                            from anterior to posterior heads), then biceps, then triceps and then repeats. Perform all sets of one exercise then 
                            move on to the next exercise in the cycle. You may rest at the end of the third exercise if necessary. This is known 
                            as a giant set (also called a superset, compound set, or circuit).</p>
                        <p><b>Warning: </b>Be careful with overhead pressing. Years of neglect of the overhead range of motion can spell disaster 
                            if the weight is not begun light enough or increases in weight are too rapid or large. Dumbbells are much easier and 
                            less restrictive on the joints than barbells.</p>

                                    <p>Grasp dumbbells in front of thighs with elbows slightly bent. Bend over slightly with hips and knees bent

                                        throughout movement. At top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to

                                        Lower heel by bending ankle until calf is stretched. Repeat. Continue with opposite leg. Keep knee straight
                                        throughout exercise or bend knee slightly only during stretch. Quadriceps serve as synergists muscle if knee is
