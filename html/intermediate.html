                        <p>Now you're familiar with the basic routine. You know how to squat/split squat/leg press. You know how to 
                            barbell bench/dumbbell bench/pushup. You know how to chin-up/lat pulldown/dumbbell row. Now everything is 
                            getting condensed into one workout: you'll go through the entire rep spectrum in one workout for each movement.
                            Welcome to the Push/Pull routine.</p>

                        <h2>Lower Push, Upper Pull</h2>
                        <p>Lower body exercises which do not involve grasping with the hands are paired with upper body exercises which 
                            do require grasping. This allows us to spread the amount of hand work being done across the week so as not 
                            to overload the weakest link (hand strength).<br>Further, spinal loading has also been spread out through 
                            the week to avoid taxing the spinal muscles too much.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <p><b>Sets:</b> Perform 3 sets. If you have time, you can perform 4 or 5 sets. Beyond 5 sets seems to produce 
                                a decrease in the amount of weight you can lift.</p>
                            <p><b>Reps:</b> The workout is structured so that the highest intensity/heaviest weight and lowest reps are 
                                done first. Adhere to this, since doing the other exercises will fatigue and compromise the truest 
                                exhibition of strength. The 5's are done first, then 10's, then 15's with their respective rest intervals.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <p><b>Increase Weight:</b> When you can do 2 more reps with the weight that you have been using for 2 workouts, 
                                you can increase weight no more than 10%.<br>Example: You start with a weight you can do for 3x3 and over 
                                the course of several weeks, you work up to 3x5. When you can do 3x5 for two workouts, you can increase 
                                the weight.</p>
                            <p><b>Intensity:</b> The 5's will be done first at 85-90% of your 1 RM<br>The 10's second at 70-75%.<br>The 15's 
                                third at 65-75%.<br>Legs must be done first in each range, since doing upper body exercises first will 
                                compromise the capacity of the lower body exercises. The reverse is not so true, however.</p>

                        <h2>Hinge, Upper Push</h2>
                        <p>The hip hinge is a crucial part of moving your body - previously we used the squat as our only method 
                            of improving your body's ability to hinge. With your progress, we need to now tax the movement directly. 
                            It is crucial that your back be kept straight and the motion be isolated to the bottom of the hips 
                            (where the gluten and hamstrings cross). </p>
                        <p>Movement between the spinal discs spells disaster, movement of these bigger running/jumping muscles means 
                            improved athleticism and strength. Plus your ass will look fantastic. Lower body exercises which involve 
                            grasping with the hands are paired with upper body exercises which do not require grasping. This allows us 
                            to spread the amount of hand work being done across the week so as not to overload the weakest link 
                            (hand strength). Further, spinal loading has also been spread out through the week to avoid taxing the 
                            spinal muscles too much.</p>

                            <p><b>Sets:</b> Perform 3 sets. If you have time, you can perform 5 sets. Beyond 5 sets seems to produce a 
                                decrease in the amount of weight you can lift.</p>
                            <p><b>Reps:</b> The workout is structured so that the highest intensity/heaviest weight and lowest reps are 
                                done first. Adhere to this, since doing the other exercises will fatigue and compromise the truest 
                                exhibition of strength. The 5's are done first, then 10's, then 15's with their respective rest 
                                intervals.</p>

                            <p><b>Increasing Weight: </b>When you can do 2 more reps with the weight that you have been using for 2 
                                workouts, you can increase weight no more than 10%.</p>
                            <p>Example: You start with a weight you can do for 3x3 and over the course of several weeks, you work up 
                                to 3x5. When you can do 3x5 for two workouts, you can increase the weight.</p>
                            <p><b>Intensity:</b> The 5's will be done at 85-90% of your 1 RM, the 10's at 70-75%. the 15's at 65-75%. 
                                Legs should be done first, since doing upper body exercises first will compromise the capacity of the 
                                lower body exercises. The reverse is not so true, however...and that's why we do legs first.</p>

                                                or slightly wider overhand or mixed grip. Lift bar by extending hips and knees to full
                                                extension. Pull shoulders back at top of lift if rounded. Return weights to floor by 
                                                bending hips back while allowing knees to bend forward, keeping back straight and knees
                                                pointed same direction as feet. Repeat. Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, 
                                                arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. 
                                                Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance
                                                often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps,
                                                grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding
                                                with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip.</li>
                                            <li><b>Sumo Deadlift:</b> Position feet under bar with very wide stance. Squat down and grasp bar
                                                between legs with shoulder width mixed grip. Face forward while positioning shoulders upward
                                                with arms straight, chest high, hips low, and back straight.Extend knees and hips until legs
                                                are straight. Return and repeat. Use shoulder width grip since narrower than shoulder width
                                                grip will make it more difficult to lockout at top. Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders
                                                high, arms and back straight, and knees pointed out same direction as feet. Also, keep bar
                                                close to body to improve mechanical leverage. With wide stance, push feet out to sides and
                                                not down to prevent knees from buckling inward. Pushing knees out will allow hips to travel
                                                toward bar more quickly while improving leverage. During rep training for powerlifting, do
                                                not merely tap weight to ground, but instead let barbell settle to ground each rep to
                                                sufficiently train range of motion through initial slack of heavy barbell. Heavy barbell

                        <p>This workout is constructed and cycles through exercising the different heads of the biggest shoulder muscle, the deltoid. We
                            will also be working the biggest arm muscles, the biceps brachii and its associated muscles as well as the triceps brachii.
                            This is also the introduction of a different type of exercise: the isolation exercise. When we work arms, we exercise muscles
                            that cross only one joint, for example, the bicep curl moves and uses just the elbow; the wrist and shoulder remain stable.
                            This is  in contrast to a compound movement, which uses two joints. For instance, the squat moves the hip and the knee joint.

                            move on to the next exercise in the cycle. You may rest at the end of the third exercise if necessary. This is known

                            if the weight is not begun light enough or increases in weight are too rapid or large. Dumbbells are much easier and 
                            less restrictive on the joints than barbells.</p>

                                </div>
                                    <p>Sit back on 45-60 degree incline bench. With arms hanging down straight, position two dumbbells 
                                        with palms facing inward. With elbows back to sides, raise one dumbbell and rotate forearm until 
                                        forearm is vertical and palm faces shoulder. Lower to original position and repeat with opposite 
                                        arm. Continue to alternate between sides. This exercise may be performed by alternating (as described),
                                        simultaneous, or in simultaneous-alternating fashion. When elbow is fully flexed, it can travel forward 
                                        slightly, allowing forearms to be no more than vertical. This additional movement allows for relative 
                                        release of tension in muscles between repetitions. </p>

                                    <p>Grasp dumbbells in front of thighs with elbows slightly bent. Bend over slightly with hips and knees bent 
                                    slightly. Raise upper arms to sides until elbows are shoulder height. Maintain elbows' height above or equal to
                                        wrists.Lower and repeat. Keep elbows pointed high while maintaining slight bend through elbows (10° to 30° angle)
                                        throughout movement. At top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to
                                        shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward. Dumbbells are raised by shoulder abduction, not external
                                        rotation. If elbows drop lower than wrists, front deltoids become primary mover instead of lateral deltoids. 
                                        To keep resistance targeted to side delt, torso is bent over slightly.</p>

                                        to allow arm pit to rest near top of pad. Back of upper arm should remain on pad throughout movement. The 
                                        long head (lateral head) of biceps brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of 
                                        biceps brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract.</p>
