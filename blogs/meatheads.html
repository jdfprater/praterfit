Meatheads

In a positive form of ad hominem arguments, of course you want to train with the giant protein sack that grunts every time he curls. Unfortunately, correlation doesn't always equal causation.

Dat spaghetti strap, doh...
Sometimes picking the most giant dude in the gym is not the best for your journey toward health, fitness, and all things sweaty and smelly.
1. Narcissistic; usually only care about his or her own training. You're just in the way - you're here to help fund them get to what they truly want to do (which is train themselves). In a job where IT'S THEIR JOB to care about the health and well-being of someone else, this might strain the empathy circuits a little too much. It's important that someone dictating what your body should be doing for an hour understand that your body may not be able to handle 500 lbs Zercher squats they did he or she did this morning and may need to build up strength and mobility doing air squats and step ups.
2. Poor social skills. Weightlifting is usually a very solitary endeavor - the people it attracts are usually running away from something else (like social interaction). They're in an environment where talking with people isn't the criteria by which they're judged.

More fun than than talking to a fish tank.
3. Have no idea what he or she is doing. How did they first start working out? Did they go to school and spend a couple of years in a lab? Did they go to a trade school? Were they trained by other experts? Have they had an anatomy course? Chances are, they were really mad about something back in high school and they took all their intensity out on themselves in the pursuit of catharsis in the gym. There's a saying, "for every great body, there was a bad breakup." They jumped to weightlifting, got lucky and didn't hurt themselves, and then called themselves an expert. There's almost no research for proper training - just an online certification that they got for less than 200 bucks, plus a culmination of broscience (stuff that they've heard from their gym buddies and stuff that they found works for them).
4. Unrepeatable results. They live like monks: they eat, sleep, and train. They got their results from such crazy intensity, bashing themselves to calm the typhoon of emotion (when we were all healthily medicating with Jack Daniels like NORMAL PEOPLE) that it just spat out a result. Their answer to improvement is to just throw themselves at a wall until something works. They spend hours a day in a gym - sacrificing time from other things (like having a life) to meditate with a dumbbell. Weird right? Well bodybuilders and meatheads are usually weird folks, which is why they comprise only a very small percentage of the population and have bodies like they do. In order to have a chance of balance across all spheres of life, you need a system that produces demonstrable results across a large group of people, not thousands of hours choosing between a gym and your daughter's birthday party.

It's ok. Your lack of parental involvement won't have any REAL consequences.
Now, is this true for EVERY buff trainer? NO.
The BEST coaches are GOING TO BE THE ONES WHO PRACTICE WHAT THEY PREACH - they're bodies and minds are going to reflect their success. Take this as a warning that there's room for discrepancy.
Unfortunately, I've seen this happen a number of times with trainers - so much so that it isn't a rarity. More like 50-50 (effective trainers vs meatheads), rather than a once-in-a-while exception. You're just as likely, if not more so, to get an idiot training you as a truly qualified professional. This is a strange instance of "looking the part" doesn't equal "being the part."
So don't be an idiot. Keep it simple, stick to what works. Nothing fancy, nothing fancy.
