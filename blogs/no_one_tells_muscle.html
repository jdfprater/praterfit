<h1>Meatheads</h1>

In the most positive of ad hominem, of course you want to train with the giant protein sack that grunts every time he curls.<br>
Unfortunately, correlation doesn't always equal causation.<br><br><br>

Dat spaghetti strap, doh...<br>
Sometimes picking the most giant dude in the gym is not the best for your journey toward health, fitness, and all things sweaty and smelly.<br>
1. Narcissistic; usually only care about his or her own training. <br>
You're just in the way - you're here to help fund them get to what they truly want to do (which is train themselves). <br>
In a job where IT'S THEIR JOB to care about the health and well-being of someone else, this might strain the empathy circuits a little too much. <br>
It's important that someone dictating what your body should be doing for an hour understand that your body may not be <br>
able to handle 500 lbs Zercher squats they did he or she did this morning and may need to build up strength and mobility <br>
doing air squats and step ups.<br><br><br>
2. Poor social skills. Weightlifting is usually a very solitary endeavor - the people it attracts are usually running away <br>
from something else (like social interaction). They're in an environment where talking with people isn't the criteria by <br>
which they're judged.<br><br>

More fun than than talking to a fish tank.<br>
3. Have no idea what he or she is doing. How did they first start working out? <br>
Did they go to school and spend a couple of years in a lab? Did they go to a trade school? Were they trained by other experts? Have they had an anatomy course? <br>
Chances are, they were really mad about something back in high school and they took all their intensity out on themselves in the pursuit of catharsis in the gym. <br>
There's a saying, "for every great body, there was a bad breakup." They jumped to weightlifting, got lucky and didn't hurt themselves, and then called themselves an expert. <br>
There's almost no research for proper training - just an online certification that they got for less than 200 bucks, plus a culmination of broscience (stuff that they've heard from <br>
their gym buddies and stuff that they found works for them).<br><br>
4. Unrepeatable results. They live like monks: they eat, sleep, and train. They got their results from such crazy intensity, bashing themselves to calm the typhoon of emotion <br>
(when we were all healthily medicating with Jack Daniels like NORMAL PEOPLE) that it just spat out a result. Their answer to improvement is to just throw themselves at a wall until something works. <br>
They spend hours a day in a gym - sacrificing time from other things (like having a life) to meditate with a dumbbell. Weird right? Well bodybuilders and meatheads are usually weird folks, which is why <br>
they comprise only a very small percentage of the population and have bodies like they do. In order to have a chance of balance across all spheres of life, you need a system that produces demonstrable results <br>
across a large group of people, not thousands of hours choosing between a gym and your daughter's birthday party.<br><br><br>

It's ok. Your lack of parental involvement won't have any REAL consequences.<br><br>
Now, is this true for EVERY buff trainer? NO.<br>
The BEST coaches are GOING TO BE THE ONES WHO PRACTICE WHAT THEY PREACH - they're bodies and minds are going to reflect their success. <br>
Take this as a warning that there's room for discrepancy.<br>
Unfortunately, I've seen this happen a number of times with trainers - so much so that it isn't a rarity. <br>
More like 50-50 (effective trainers vs meatheads), rather than a once-in-a-while exception. You're just as likely, if not more so, to get an idiot training you as a truly qualified professional. <br>
This is a strange instance of "looking the part" doesn't equal "being the part."<br><br>
Don't be an idiot, don't be theh sucker. Keep it simple, stick to what works. Nothing fancy, nothing fancy.<br>
