<h1>Health VS. Fitness</h1><br><br>

Quick – what does a healthy person look like?<br><br>

<img src="../pictures/muscleguy.png"><img src="../pictures/musclegirl.png"><br><br>

Ha. Nope.<br><br>

“But John, look how toned they are! They don’t look too muscly or bulky.<br>
They look fit and lean and I’ll bet they eat the right things and workout and…”<br><br>

Well, you’re right about all those things…but I guarantee you, none of what they did was to get “healthy.” <br>
They wanted to look a certain way, so they did what it took to get there, regardless of whether or not it was good for them. <br>
It took a lot of work, a lot of time, and a lot of dedication to get exactly to the point where their genetics allowed them 
to look like that.<br><br>

“Well, maybe they did spend a little too much time in the gym. I don’t want to go that far.
Does this look better? These people look a lot more functional and healthy.”<br><br>

<img src="../pictures/runner.png"><img src="../pictures/swimmer.png"><br><br>

Those are two Olympic athletes – they probably care less about how they look, but everything they did was to <br>
improve their ability to perform a certain task. They’re definitely fit to run/swim.<br><br>

“Wait, so health is different from fitness? People always say ‘health & fitness’ – I assumed they always went hand-in-hand.”<br><br>

Health IS different from fitness! Most everyone thinks they're two sides to the same coin when in actuallity, they are almost 
exclusive.<br>
Advertising, media portrayal, general consensus....we’re ALWAYS shown pictures of fitness and told it’s the
picture of health. It’s not.<br><br>

Health is concerned with how long we live, with our quality of life…exercise is definitely a part of it, but it also <br>
is concerned with nutrition, sleep, stress, relationships, friendships, job satisfaction…particularly the QUALITY of those<br>
things. Those contribute to health among a myriad of other things.<br><br>

Fitness is much simpler: how good are you at doing something? How fast can you run a mile? How much weight can you lift?<br>
That’s even where looks and aesthetics reside: how fit is your body to look a certain way. <br>
Can you get it to the point where it makes the primal part of our brains think “oh, that’s attractive”?<br>
So questions like how low your bodyfat is and how big is your bicep is are concerned with numbers and metrics.<br>
Now, a certain amount of fitness is required in order to get through our daily lives: some people have to be more fit<br>
than others to get through the day. A construction worker needs more fitness than a lawyer to do his work and not hurt himself.<br>
A 80 year-old needs to be fit enough to put the cereal box in the cabinet and get out the car, and strong enough to catch him<br>
or herself if he or she falls.<br><br>

But nobody NEEDS a six pack. Nobody NEEDS to run a mile in 6 minutes or bench press 500 lbs.<br><br>

 “So what do I need to know in order to maximize my health, then? What do I need to work on?”<br><br>
Guys: 15-18% bodyfat. Girls 22-25%. 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise per week. <br>
6 servings of fruits and veggies a day. Don’t drink too much alcohol. Don’t smoke. Have good relationships <br>
with your friends and family. Sleep 6-8 hours a night.  <br><br>

<img src="../pictures/bodyfat.png"><br><br>

“That’s not really exciting.”<br><br>

Nope. 400 lb deadlift backflips and having a six pack are exciting. It might kill you, though.<br><br>

But fitness doesn’t care about your quality of life. It doesn’t care about health. <br>
Many athletes have compromised their body’s ability to function normally in order to get more performance out of it. <br>
Some famous guy who played tennis, Roger Federer, would not be able to walk without almost an hour of warming up <br>
because of the amount and intensity of training he put his body through to be the best at his sport.<br>
He had to crawl on his stomach to his child’s crib when he woke up in the middle of the night.<br><br>

Dan John, the Olympic shot putter, could not carry his brief case because of the pain in his right arm - all that <br>
arm could do was put shot further than almost anyone else in the world.<br><br>

The female gymnasts that dazzle us every 4 years with flips and twists? Often, the intensity of their training prevents<br>
menarche, the onset of the normal female reproductive cycle. Many have the bone-mineral density of 80 year-olds.<br><br>

When a bodybuilder steps on stage or a fitness model shows up to his or her photo shoot, he or she is at the weakest point<br>
in a training regime – the body is dehydrated, it has been exhausted from hours of exercise, and weakened from the lack<br>
of nutrition in order to create the look we all aspire to achieve.<br><br>

Be careful what you wish for. Know what you’ll have to sacrifice and what you’ll have to do – and come to grips with <br>
what is realistic. I’m not saying you can’t achieve it; you can if you practice the habits required of it, but understand <br>
what your goals are.<br><br>

Ultimately, health and fitness are both just goals and ways of thinking about what we can achieve with our bodies –<br>
they’re both fine; there is nothing morally wrong with either. But once you start caring about how much you can bench or <br>
whether you can see abs regardless of what’s best and healthiest for your body, you’ll definitely get fit. <br><br>

Sure, that counts.
